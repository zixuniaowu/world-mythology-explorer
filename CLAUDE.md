# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This directory is currently empty with no project files, build configuration, or documentation present.

When a project is initialized in this directory, this file should be updated with:
- Build, test, and lint commands specific to the project
- High-level architecture and code structure
- Key development workflows and patterns

Until then, Claude Code should help with project initialization based on the user's requirements.
